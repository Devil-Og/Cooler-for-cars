                <p>Our community is very peaceful. Outside the Minecraft servers, in our Discord servers, you can easily talk to our mods and sometimes with the owner. We have a huge community of many other Minecraft players from different countries, all playing peacefully together. We always try to create some events to entertain everyone here, and everything is free!</p>
